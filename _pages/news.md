## January 2026: 
Back in SF for SPIE Photonics West! It was a busy but rewarding week giving two talks on our curvature-adaptive gigapixel microscopy and high-throughput 3D zebrafish profiling systems (watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXfsqg_8Y6I&t)). The "cherry on top" was unexpectedly meeting Prof. Joseph Goodman—an unforgettable moment for any optics researcher!

## January 2025: 
My first visit to SPIE Photonics West! Although I didn't present this year, it was a fantastic opportunity to learn from the best in the industry and build new connections. Grateful for the inspiration that sparked new research ideas.

## May 2023:
Presented my first conference talk at BME 2023 (Suzhou, China) on our work regarding the full estimation of optical properties for thin *ex vivo* tissues using deep learning. It was a privilege to be the sole undergraduate speaker in my session.
