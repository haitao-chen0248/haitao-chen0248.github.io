## January 2026: 
Back in SF for SPIE Photonics West 2026! It was a busy but rewarding week giving two talks on our curvature-adaptive gigapixel microscopy and high-throughput 3D zebrafish profiling systems (watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXfsqg_8Y6I&t)). The "cherry on top" was unexpectedly meeting Prof. Joseph Goodman—an unforgettable moment for any optics researcher!
