I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University, advised by Prof. [Roarke Horstmeyer](https://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/). Prior to Duke, I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technolog in 2024 with a B.Eng. in biomedical engineering, where I was introduced to the world of biomedical photonics. In particular, I did some research involving tissue optics and fluorescence diffuse optical tomography with Prof. [Yong Deng](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/dengyong/en/index.htm) at the [Britton Chance Center for Biomedical Photonics](http://english.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/). Additionally, I contributed to research on photoacoustic tomography at Rice University, advised by Prof. [Lei Li](https://www.light-leili.com/).
