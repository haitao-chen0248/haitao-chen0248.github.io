I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Duke Universityâ€™s [Computational Optics Lab](https://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/), advised by Prof. [Roarke Horstmeyer](https://bme.duke.edu/people/roarke-horstmeyer/). 

My research interests lie broadly in computational imaging, tomography reconstruction algorithms, inverse problems, and machine learning, with a focus on the development of high-throughput optical imaging systems. Beyond this, I am always open to exploring new ways of applying computational optimization and extending advanced imaging systems to other biomedical contexts.

Prior to Duke, I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2024 with a B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering, where I was introduced to the world of biomedical photonics. In particular, I did some research involving tissue optics and fluorescence diffuse optical tomography with Prof. [Yong Deng](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/dengyong/en/index.htm) at the [Britton Chance Center for Biomedical Photonics](http://english.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/). I also had the opportunity to contribute to research on photoacoustic tomography at Rice University, advised by Prof. [Lei Li](https://www.light-leili.com/).
